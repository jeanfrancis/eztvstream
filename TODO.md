* [ ] need a way to view watched shows & allow user to mark them "unwatched"
* [ ] smarter watch-marking that sees how much of the show you really watched (like Plex)
* [ ] next/previous when watching a show
* [ ] next on video end
* [ ] save watched & subscriptions remote without user-login
* [ ] switch to ionic over bootstrap
* [ ] transcode pipe HTML5-unsupported video files
* [ ] remove lodash, & replace searches if I am still using it
* [X] handle HTML5 url stuff better, in client-side (jump to correct route on refresh)
* [ ] fix issue with `gulp --type production`, as it seems broken
